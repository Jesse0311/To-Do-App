The app starts with a List Category Input field to add Lists, basically a title
for your tasks. 
Each list category that is created, by clicking on the + button, is clickable 
and will show a Task Menu with the name of your selected list as the title.
Each list category created holds two buttons, one button is to edit the text within
the list and the second button is to remove the specific list.
Once a list is selected
and the Task Menu shows, you're able to add tasks and/or a due dates.
Each task that is
added will increase the Tasks Remaining, but will decrease once the Task has been checked.
You can check tasks by clicking on them, and remove checked tasks by clicking on the button underneath
the Task Menu called "Clear Completed Tasks".
Each selected List will have its own tasks
in the Tasks Menu.
When you click on the button to remove the selected List, the Tasks Menu will 
hide because there is no longer a list that is selected.
If you remove a list that is not selected,
it will not affect the Tasks Menu but it will remove all Tasks associated with the specific list.
When editing the text inside the list, once you click on the edit button you are automatically able
to type as the app will focus on the list text.
When adding a due date, the user will not be able to select a date earlier than the current day, nor
a date that is later than a year after the current date.
